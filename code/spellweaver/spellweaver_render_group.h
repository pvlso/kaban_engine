/* NOTE(casey):

   1) Everywhere outside the renderer, Y _always_ goes upward, X to the right.

   2) All bitmaps including the render target are assumed to be bottom-up
      (meaning that the first row pointer points to the bottom-most row
       when viewed on screen).

   3) It is mandatory that all inputs to the renderer are in world
      coordinates ("meters"), NOT pixels.  If for some reason something
      absolutely has to be specified in pixels, that will be explicitly
      marked in the API, but this should occur exceedingly sparingly.

   4) Z is a special coordinate because it is broken up into discrete slices,
      and the renderer actually understands these slices.  Z slices are what
      control the _scaling_ of things, whereas Z offsets inside a slice are
      what control Y offsetting.

   5) All color values specified to the renderer as V4's are in
      NON-premulitplied alpha.
